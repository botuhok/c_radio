# c_radio
I try to simplify my life and turn on my favorite radio stations (including those on YouTube) through the mpv console mode. 
The list of radio stations and links to it are located in the 'index' file. To add or remove something, you should edit it!
Also you need install curses-menu and mpv
so:


>> pip install curses-menu
>> 
>> pacman -S mpv /or/ apt install mpv


Then you can just run script via
>> ./c_radio.py
